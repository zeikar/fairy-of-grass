# Fairy of Grass :fairy:
:octocat: Auto generating Github contributions everyday using Github Actions.

# Translations
[한국어](https://github.com/zeikar/fairy-of-grass/blob/master/ko.README.md)

# How to use
1. :arrow_down: Clone this repository. (Do not fork. [Commits made in a fork will not count toward your contributions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile#commit-was-made-in-a-fork))
2. :lock: Add your Github email address in Github Secrets as USER_EMAIL. ([Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository))
3. :smile: Done!

# How it works
It runs once a day around 12:00 (GMT), UTC +0. And it makes an empty commit to add contribution to your Github profile.
