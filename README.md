# fairy-of-grass
:octocat: Auto generating Github contributions everyday using Github Actions.

# Translations
[한국어](https://github.com/zeikar/fairy-of-grass/blob/master/ko.README.md)

# How to use
1. :fork_and_knife: Fork or clone this repository.
2. :lock: Add your Github email address in Github Secrets as USER_EMAIL. ([Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository))

3. :smile: Done!

# How it works
It runs once a day around 12:00 (GMT), UTC +0. And it makes an empty commit to add contribution to your Github profile.
